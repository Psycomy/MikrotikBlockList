# Maintenance guide

Resumen en español al final / Spanish summary at the end.

The project runs on its own: a daily build publishes the lists, and routers fetch them. Problems
show up as **issues opened by the workflows**, so you get a GitHub e-mail instead of having to
check anything. Each issue is updated when the problems change and closed automatically when a
later run is healthy.

| Issue label | Opened by | When |
|---|---|---|
| `build-health` | `build` workflow, daily schedule | a source failed or came back empty, a CDN list fell back to the snapshot, IPv6 was withheld, the lists are stale or the run did not publish |
| `routeros-e2e` | `routeros-e2e` workflow, weekly | the installer fails its end-to-end tests on the **latest stable** RouterOS |
| `cdn-snapshot` | `cdn-snapshot` workflow, monthly | the live CDN ranges no longer match `allowlist-cdn.snapshot.txt` |

You can run the same health check locally at any time:

```bash
python3 -m mbl health --stats https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Psycomy/MikroBlockList/lists/stats.json
```

It prints one line per problem (nothing when healthy) and exits with 3 when there is a problem.

## Lookup page

The "is this IP listed?" page lives in `site/` and is served at
<https://psycomy.github.io/MikroBlockList/>. It reads `lookup.json` from the `lists` branch (written
by the daily `build`) and is deployed by the `pages` workflow on pushes that touch `site/**`.

**One-time setup:** in the repository go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source:
GitHub Actions**. Until that is set, the first `pages` run fails; rerun it afterwards.

## `build-health` lines

- **`source X failed: ...`**: the download failed. One bad day is normal (the source is optional
  and the build tolerates it). If it lasts about a week, open the source URL from `sources.toml`:
  - moved: update `url` through a PR;
  - gone or no longer free for home use: set `enabled = false` with a comment saying why (as was
    done for ThreatFox) and, if you want a replacement, check its license first.
  A *required* source that fails stops the whole build instead (see "did not publish" below).
- **`source X returned no entries`**: the download worked but nothing was parsed, which usually
  means the format changed. Compare the file with its `format` in `sources.toml`; fix the parser in
  `mbl/parsers.py` with an updated fixture in `tests/fixtures/`, or disable the source.
- **`CDN allowlist X: live list rejected, used the snapshot`**: the provider changed its URL or
  format (see `PROVIDERS` in `mbl/cdn.py`). The build keeps working with the snapshot; fix the
  provider entry when you can. **`... and no snapshot, built without it`** is the same problem
  without a fallback: that provider's ranges are not allowlisted until it is fixed, so fix it soon.
- **`IPv6 lists were withheld`**: IPv4 was published, IPv6 kept the previous files. The run log has
  the reason (`warning: IPv6 not published, ...`), usually an IPv6 count outside its limits.
- **`the build did not publish`** or **`the published lists are N days old`**: open the run log.
  - A safety check stopped it (drop over 50 %, growth over 2x, entry limits). If the change is
    expected, for example after adding a source, run the `build` workflow by hand with
    **allow_growth** (growth only). A real drop usually means a source broke: see above.
  - The allowlist cap stopped it: see [the security guide](security.md#when-the-allowlist-cap-stops-the-build).
  Routers keep their last good list meanwhile and log `MBL: list is N days old` after a few days.
- **`warning: lookup.json not published (...)`** (in the run log, not an issue): the data for the
  [lookup page](https://psycomy.github.io/MikroBlockList/) was skipped; the lists were still
  published. `lookup.json` is then absent from the `lists` branch until the next good build, and the page shows "list unavailable". The reason is in the parentheses; once the cause is gone, rerun the `build` workflow to fix it.
- **`warning: DB-IP unavailable (...); lookup.json without countries`**: the DB-IP Country Lite
  file (CC BY 4.0, cached monthly in Actions by `python -m mbl dbip-fetch --cache .dbip`) was
  missing or unreadable. The page works but shows no countries. Rerun the `build` workflow; if it
  persists, check the download URL in `mbl/geo.py`.
- **`stats.json unavailable`**: the `lists` branch or raw.githubusercontent.com could not be read;
  check that the branch exists and that the latest `build` run published.

## `routeros-e2e` issue

A new RouterOS release probably broke something. First check which step failed: a setup step
(apt, QEMU, the image download) is a CI problem, not a RouterOS one, and the next weekly run
usually closes the issue. Otherwise download the `routeros-e2e-logs` artifact of the run (console
and router logs), then reproduce locally with that version:

```bash
MBL_E2E=1 MBL_E2E_CHR_VERSION=<version> python3 -m unittest tests.e2e.test_routeros -v
```

Fix `routeros/install.rsc` (bump the script version, see below). Once it passes, you can pin the new
version in `tests/e2e/chr-version.txt` (`<version> <sha256 of chr-<version>.img.zip>`; the run's
summary prints the checksum).

## `cdn-snapshot` issue

The issue links to a compare page: open the pull request from it (a PR opened by you runs the
normal checks), check the diff and merge it. The next monthly run closes the issue. If the issue
says the live lists could not be downloaded, it may be a one-off network error (the next monthly
run closes it) or the same provider problem as above.

## Dependabot pull requests

Once a month Dependabot proposes updated versions of the GitHub Actions used by the workflows, in
a single PR. Merge it when its checks pass.

## Scheduled workflows and inactivity

GitHub disables scheduled workflows in a repository with no activity for 60 days, and sends an
e-mail before doing so. If you get that e-mail, re-enable the workflow under *Actions* (or merge
any PR, such as the Dependabot one). While the build is disabled no issue can warn you, but routers
log `MBL: list is N days old`.

## Changing the router script

Every change to `routeros/install.rsc` needs:

1. the new version in both `VERSION` and `mblScriptVersion` (a unit test checks they match);
2. a `CHANGELOG.md` entry;
3. a green `e2e` check on the PR.

After the merge the published lists carry the new `script=` value and installed routers log
`MBL: script X available (installed Y)`; reinstalling with the one-liner upgrades them.

## Once a year

- Review the terms of every source (`license_note` in `sources.toml`, the README table): still
  free, still fine for home / non-commercial use.
- Look for new free sources that add coverage without overlapping the current ones.

## Resumen en español

- El proyecto funciona solo. Los problemas llegan como **incidencias que abren los workflows**, que
  recibes por correo, y que se cierran solas cuando una ejecución posterior va bien:
  - `build-health`, diaria: fuente caída o vacía, CDN usando la copia, IPv6 retenida, listas sin
    actualizar o build sin publicar;
  - `routeros-e2e`, semanal: la última RouterOS estable rompe el instalador;
  - `cdn-snapshot`, mensual: los rangos de las CDN ya no coinciden con la copia.
- Comprobación manual: `python3 -m mbl health --stats <URL de stats.json>`.
- Fuente caída una semana: corrige la URL o desactívala (`enabled = false` con el motivo). Fuente vacía:
  cambió el formato (parser y fixture). Build detenido: mira el log; si el crecimiento es esperado,
  lanza el workflow a mano con **allow_growth**; si es el tope de la allowlist, ver la guía de seguridad.
- `cdn-snapshot`: abre el PR desde el enlace de la incidencia y fusiónalo cuando el CI esté en verde.
- `routeros-e2e`: reproduce en local con `MBL_E2E_CHR_VERSION=<versión>`, corrige el instalador y
  sube la versión del script.
- Dependabot: un PR al mes con las Actions actualizadas; fusiónalo si el CI pasa.
- Si GitHub avisa de que va a desactivar los workflows programados por inactividad (60 días),
  reactívalos en *Actions* o fusiona cualquier PR.
- Cada cambio en el script del router: `VERSION` y `mblScriptVersion`, CHANGELOG y `e2e` en verde.
- Una vez al año: revisa las licencias de las fuentes y busca fuentes nuevas.
